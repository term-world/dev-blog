Writing about our work this summer, we've been weaving our way through topics 
which verge on technical detail; verbally illustrating the balancing act that
this work requires seems to mean that we work out some of our own thoughts on
the blog. We thank you for your patience as we think aloud in public. I (partly)
come from the world of composition theory, so here I name-check Janet Emig's
["Writing as a Mode of Learning"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/356095). (At
Allegheny, we often don't distinguish "code" writing (formal language) from what
most folks would call writing (natural language), so here I mean Emig's essay to
work in many senses.)

(Tangent, and probably interesting for a later blog post, you should see all of the
sheets of paper containing drawings and other scrawl that we've created to explain
our ideas to each other.)

This post zooms out a bit, returning to thinking about _how_ one might build a teaching
machine at a time of significant technical advance (since B.F. Skinner and others' early
work on the topic) coupled with our need to build a system that teaches technical topics.
My first shot at using a collaborative cloud platform, an implementation of 
[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) found major support in Barba, et al.'s digital text 
[_Teaching and Learning with Jupyter_](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/).
