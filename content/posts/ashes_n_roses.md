## The Ashes of Disaster

I grew up in a family that ritualistically watched movies together every Friday night. Generally speaking,
these were new flicks picked up from Family Video (R.I.P.) but there were a few family favorites that
made fairly regular appearances. One such favorite was *Chitty Chitty Bang-Bang*. It's been many, *many*
years since I last saw it, so I couldn't tell you what the movie was really about (beyond being an
elaborate fever dream that involves a flying car and an awful lot of singing and dancing) but there's one
song from the movie that has stuck with me over the years. Or, more accurately, one *line* from one
song that has stuck with me.

*From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success.*

There's no doubt about it: the debut of `term-world`, in spite of all the hard work and lofty hopes we
dumped into it, was *disastrous*. I winced when I saw the first hand shoot up in front of a
blank white screen on that first day that a classroom full of introductory computer science students
actually tried logging onto the platform. While I was trying to troubleshoot with that student, I watched
in horror as more and more hands shot up across the room. My heart sank as murmurs about a mysterious
and malevolent "proxy error" swelled throughout the classroom.

Though the class session was recovered by a quick-thinking instructor, there was still a sour taste leftover
by the session. The following session students were presented with a choice: they could opt-in to continue
to test a platform that was still going through development, or they could tackle the class content
on an established platform (Jupyter). About a quarter of the students opted-in--honestly more than we
fairly could've hoped for given the dismal first day in the world.

Though the transition was a little messy at first, Luman was able to scrape the paint off of our broken
canvas and move it to the more established Jupyter platform for the students that didn't want to wonder
if they were going to be able to log-in without issue.

I for one was pretty sure that--given this awful first impression of the course--we were sunk for getting
students bought-in to the *magic* of what we had spent the summer building. For the first week and a half,
it certainly seemed that way. If students weren't dealing with instability on the `term-world` platform,
then they were struggling against unforeseen bugs that resulted from transitioning the content we had
painstakingly created to Jupyter. It was one headache after another, and if *I* had been the instructor
in charge of the classroom, I might've just cut my losses and dredged up old activities and curriculum
to make it through the semester. Credit to Luman, whose dogged dedication to `term-world` and everything
it was trying to be gave the content (and the platform) just enough time to see the other shoe drop.

## The Roses of Success

Towards the end of the second week, as students were trying to program an automated vacuum to clear out
the debris and detritus from their virtual garages, one student saw their vacuum suddenly whir to life
instead of being faced with yet another message suggesting their computations were a little off. 
In past posts we've all reflected on the *joy* that comes with that first time that a burgeoning
programmer makes something consequential happen. But having those consequences play out and *directly*
impact the little virtual world these students were inhabiting must've helped crank up that high:
rather than sitting back and admiring a job well done, the student in question asked, "So, what's next?!"

As a student enrolled at Allegheny myself, in the past couple weeks I've crossed paths with students
taking CMSPC100 course that `term-world` has taken over. I've been asked several times about what's
coming next to `term-world`, what new parts of the world the students will see and have a chance to
shape in their own image.

In the week following the garage clean-up activity, students were tasked with planting a flower bed
in their backyard. Their work was cleverly rewarded with an image file that displayed the flowers
they had planted after figuring out how to till the soil required for the bed. To speak of more literal
*roses of success*, this image could be manipulated by curious and persistent students, and a number of
students invested more time into perfecting their flower beds (a purely optional activity) than they put
into completing any of the other required asks of the week.

The flowerbed activity was dreamt up by Luman as an *aside* to the content for the week in question,
but given the *tangible* and *consequential* feeling of directly impacting their virtual space, students
have gone at the activity with more gusto than anyone in my own introductory computer science course
might've tackled any of the required assignments. As I write this, students are awaiting the results of a
classwide vote to determine the best flower bed, with a carefully planted image of the red *Among Us*
currently leading the race.

Not to mention, but since that first week Luman has spent many, *many* man-hours working at righting
`term-world` from a platform perspective. Some of his work involves leveraging logic used by Docker
to manage containerization...but I'll let him discuss his endeavors himself in a later post. The long
and short of it is a few students have been asking about transitioning *back* to the proper `term-world`
platform given the improvements that have been made, a phenomenon that wasn't exactly expected given
that first roll-out day.

Time will tell if we're able to maintain the joy and magic of simply *making* things as we continue
to expose students to more complex programming fundamentals. However, thinking about the experiences
I've had with students so far, I'm optimistic that we'll continue to see the roses of success bud
and bloom throughout the semester.
