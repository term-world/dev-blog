This is a sample blog post, which could be used to share the latest (mis)adventure in the epic saga that is the development of TermWorld. The idea would be to create these posts on a weekly basis (perhaps posting at the end of each development week, on Friday), with the authorship shifting with each post. If you're interested in some ideas on what types of discussion could be included to set the "foundation" for the blog posts, click into the post itself for a more detailed plan of some potential "introductory" blog posts to get things up and running.

**POST ON FRIDAY, 5/20**

**AUTHOR: LUMAN**

To get the ball rolling, Luman could write a brief post about his experience teaching CMPSC 100 for the past three years at Allegheny. He could discuss some of his findings about what is/isn't effective when it comes to teaching an introductory computer science course, and perhaps mention what some of the shortcomings of earlier iterations of CMPSC 100 were, and how they motivated him to consider teaching the course in a brand-new way.

**POST ON FRIDAY, 5/27**

**AUTHOR: JEFF**

This post would detail some of the "pre-work" that went into getting a plan set for the summer's work. Conversations dreaming up TermWorld, drafting up a possible curricular blueprint, the process of submitting the proposal, perhaps Luman's experience scouting students to collaborate with, etc.

**POST ON FRIDAY, 6/3**

**AUTHOR: LUMAN**

The first real-time development post! At this point Luman & Mai will have been working on TermWorld for a week--what has been accomplished at this point? Luman will write the first real-time development post to set a framework for the types of information that ought to be included in following weeks' posts. The content for the remaining weeks' post (at least until the conclusion of the summer project) should be fairly self-explanatory.

**POST ON FRIDAY, 8/5**

**AUTHOR: LUMAN**

This might be a good space to recap what other to-do's (if any) there are in order to get TermWorld classroom ready.

Beyond this week, once the semester starts up I'd suggest having Luman and any students still involved with the class from a TL perspective continue blog posts to talk through the first semester of execution.
