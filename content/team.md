{{/*
  TO-DO: include a basic bio for each team member. No more than three sentences:

  * Description of their "role" in the team (perhaps semi-serious/novelty)
  * *Very* basic education/professional background where applicable--captured in one sentence
  * Their answer to the question, "Why TermWorld?"

  Also, *maybe* consider adding a photo / alternatively, pixel-art portraits of each team member
