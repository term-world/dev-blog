### Why `term-world`?

Returning to the classroom from the "remote" era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear to me that the site and purpose of the classroom was forever changed. In response,
I started having conversations with students about ways in which education could respond to this change. Based on the "applied" approach of the Allegheny CS department, we chose
an immersive digital, open-world environment as our experimental space.
