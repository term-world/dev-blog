<!--
  TO-DO: include a basic bio for each team member. No more than three sentences:

  * Description of their "role" in the team (perhaps semi-serious/novelty)
  * *Very* basic education/professional background where applicable--captured in one sentence
  * Their answer to the question, "Why TermWorld?"

  Also, *maybe* consider adding a photo / alternatively, pixel-art portraits of each team member

#### Why `term-world`?

Returning to the classroom from the "remote" era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear to me that the site and purpose of the classroom was forever changed. In response,
I started having conversations with students about ways in which education could respond to this change. Based on the "applied" approach of the Allegheny CS department, we chose
an immersive digital, open-world environment as our experimental space.

#### Responsibilities

* Maintains the perfect shade of orange for the blog
* Asks if other team members have eaten yet
* Walks the termite

#### Background

* [Senior Team Lead, Target](https://www.target.com/)
* [Student, Allegheny College](https://allegheny.edu/)

#### Why `term-world`?

CMPSC100 exposed me to the *magic* of creating and manipulating digital realities, and that experience was so intense and eye-opening for me that I just *had* to be involved with that transformative onboarding process well after I was meant to graduate beyond it. I persistently asked for ways to maintain my involvement with the course, Luman eventually caved, and here I am.
