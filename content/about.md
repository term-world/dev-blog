In April 2022, the TermWorld team submitted a proposal to Allegheny College's Department of Undergraduate Research, Scholarship, & Creative Activities (URSCA) to secure funding to build TermWorld as part of a collaborative research project. The guiding principles behind the planning, development, and execution of TermWorld in the classroom are most succinctly captured in the below excerpt from that original proposal:

---

*This project aims to apply “gamification” pedagogy in design and development of a new
approach to the computer science course (CMPSC 100) at Allegheny College. The outcome, a
persistent, immersive digital environment called “TermWorld,” would provide both a playground
and persistent digital metaphor through which to consider real-world ethical and civil questions
regarding governance, justice, equity, and other social infrastructures not typically included in
computer science education. This project leverages both interdisciplinary principles and students
as co-developers to explore new applications of pedagogy not necessarily limited to the
discipline of computer science.*
